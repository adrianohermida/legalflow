# ✅ Dashboard Route Fix - Completed

## 🔍 Problem Identified
- User was getting 404 error when accessing `/dashboard`
- The app only had routes for `/` (root) but not explicit `/dashboard` routes
- This caused confusion as many users expect `/dashboard` to work

## 🔧 Solution Applied

### Added Missing Routes:

**Demo Mode:**
- ✅ `/dashboard` → `DashboardV2` component
- ✅ `/dashboard-v2` → `DashboardV2` component
- ✅ `/` → `DashboardV2` component (existing)

**Regular Mode:**
- ✅ `/dashboard` → `Dashboard` component  
- ✅ `/dashboard-v2` → `DashboardV2` component
- ✅ `/` → `Dashboard` component (existing)

## 🎯 Routes Now Available

| URL | Demo Mode | Regular Mode |
|-----|-----------|--------------|
| `/` | DashboardV2 | Dashboard |
| `/dashboard` | DashboardV2 | Dashboard |
| `/dashboard-v2` | DashboardV2 | DashboardV2 |

## ✅ Test Results
- Hot reload applied successfully
- No compilation errors
- All dashboard routes should now work correctly

## 📝 Next Steps
The `/dashboard` route is now properly configured and should resolve the 404 error. Users can access the dashboard via:
- `/` (root)
- `/dashboard` 
- `/dashboard-v2`

All routes are protected by authentication and will redirect appropriately based on the current auth mode (demo vs Supabase).
